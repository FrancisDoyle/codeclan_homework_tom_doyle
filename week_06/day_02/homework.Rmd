Question 1.
Load the data, clean_names() and explore it.

```{r}
phones <- read_csv("data/20190928-items.csv")

phones %>% 
  skim()
```


Question 2.
Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the dataset. Samsung 397

```{r}
phones %>% 
  group_by(brand) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```


Question 3.
For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?
Hint
You will need to calculate the and of the ratings to plot the appropriate normal distribution. Alternatively, investigate using the function in the package]

```{r}
samsung <- phones %>% filter(brand == "Samsung")
```

```{r}
samsung %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), bins = 20, fill = "lightblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Samsung Phone Ratings distribution", x = "Rating", y = "Density")+
  geom_density(fill = "transparent", color = "blue", size = 1)


```



Question 4.

Hint
You can use a to get only the ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean, and then think about how to calculate what proportion each of these filtered sets make of the total number of ratings. Youâ€™ll need to use three separate and pipes to do this.
Further hint - code to filter within one SD 


```{r}
mean_rating <- mean(phones$rating)
sd_rating <- sd(phones$rating)


```
