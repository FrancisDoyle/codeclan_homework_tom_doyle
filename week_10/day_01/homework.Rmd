```{r}
management_data <- read_csv("data/project_management.csv")
```
```{r}
management_data %>% 
    ggplot(aes(estimated_length,actual_length))+
  geom_point()
```
```{r}
management_data %>% 
  summarise(cor = cor(estimated_length,actual_length))
```

very strong positive cor

Perform a simple linear regression using actual_length as the dependent variable, and estimated_length as the independent variable. Save the model object to a variable.

```{r}
model <- lm(formula = actual_length ~ estimated_length, data = management_data)
```


Interpret the regression coefficient of estimated_length (i.e. slope, gradient) you obtain from the model. How do you interpret the r2

value reported by the model?
